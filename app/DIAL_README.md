# Enhanced dial - The Permissions Facilitator v3.0

A delightfully enhanced device permissions helper that maintains all the personality and charm of the original while adding powerful new features.

## üé≠ What Makes dial Special

dial is not just another permissions script - it's an **entertainment experience** that solves a real problem. Choose from 5 distinct personalities:

- **üë®‚Äçüî¨ Wizard**: Mystical and wise, speaks of artifacts and rituals
- **ü§ñ GLaDOS**: Sarcastic AI from Portal, treats you like a test subject  
- **üè∞ DM**: D&D dungeon master, frames everything as guild membership
- **üò§ Sassy**: Impatient but helpful, gets straight to the point
- **üòè Sarcastic**: Dry wit and barely contained frustration

## üöÄ Enhanced Features (v3.0)

### ‚ú® **Smart Device Discovery**
- Auto-discovers devices by category (serial, video, audio, USB, storage)
- Suggests alternatives when specified device isn't found
- Shows device ownership and group information

### üîç **Status & Information**
- Check current group memberships (`-c, --check`)
- List all available devices (`-l, --list`) 
- Scan for devices (`-s, --scan`)
- Verbose logging for debugging (`-v, --verbose`)

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**
- Dry-run mode shows what would happen (`-n, --dry-run`)
- Checks if user already has access (no unnecessary changes)
- Operation logging for audit trails
- Enhanced error handling with helpful suggestions

### üì± **Modern CLI**
- Long and short options (`--help` and `-h`)

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Quick Start (Legacy Compatible)
```bash
# Original usage still works perfectly
dial                    # Random personality, default device
```

### New Enhanced Usage
```bash
# Check what groups you're already in
dial -c
dial --check

# List all available devices  
dial -l
dial --list

# Scan for devices interactively
dial -s
dial --scan

# Dry run to see what would happen
dial -n -d /dev/ttyUSB0
dial --dry-run --device /dev/video0

# Verbose output for debugging
dial -v -p wizard -d /dev/ttyACM0

# Specific personality and device
dial -p glados -d /dev/video1
```

### Device Categories

The enhanced dial automatically categorizes devices:

- **Serial**: `/dev/ttyACM*`, `/dev/ttyUSB*`, `/dev/ttyS*` ‚Üí `dialout`/`uucp` groups
- **Video**: `/dev/video*`, `/dev/dri/card*` ‚Üí `video` group  
- **Audio**: `/dev/snd/*`, `/dev/audio*` ‚Üí `audio` group
- **USB**: `/dev/bus/usb/*/*` ‚Üí Various groups
- **Storage**: `/dev/sd*`, `/dev/nvme*` ‚Üí `disk` group

## üéØ Smart Error Handling

When dial can't find your device, it doesn't just fail - it helps:

```
Device '/dev/ttyACM0' not found. Did you forget to plug it in?

Available devices that might work:

  serial devices:
    /dev/ttyS0 (owner: root, group: uucp)
    /dev/ttyUSB0 (owner: root, group: dialout)
    ...

Usage examples:
  dial -d /dev/ttyUSB0    # Specific device  
  dial -s                 # Scan and choose
```

## üìä Operation Logging

All operations are logged to `~/.local/share/dial/history.log`:

```
[2025-09-09 23:45:12] dry_run: device=/dev/ttyS0, group=uucp, status=simulated
[2025-09-09 23:46:33] check: device=/dev/video0, group=video, status=already_member
[2025-09-09 23:47:45] add_to_group: device=/dev/ttyUSB0, group=dialout, status=success
```

## üé™ Personality Examples

### GLaDOS Mode
```
====================================================================
Aperture Science Permissions Facilitator
Mandated Acknowledgment: Conceived by ShadowHarvy  
====================================================================

Oh, look. Another test subject... I mean, *user*... requires access adjustments.

-> Right. Let's analyze your... *quaint*... security configuration for device '/dev/video0'.
   Device '/dev/video0' detected. Minimal compliance noted.
-> Executing primitive command to determine group ownership...
   Analysis complete. The group with access privileges is: 'video'.

Interesting. You're already in group 'video'. Did you forget, or are you just testing me?

No action required. The system is already perfectly configured. Unlike your judgment.
```

### Wizard Mode with Dry Run
```
====================================================================
The Oracle of Device Access
A spell by: ShadowHarvy
====================================================================

[DRY RUN MODE] - No actual changes will be made
The Oracle peers into possible futures without disturbing the present...

-> Let us consult the system's arcane energies for device '/dev/ttyS0'...
   The artifact '/dev/ttyS0' has been detected.
-> Scrying for the guardian group of the artifact...
   The guardian group is revealed to be 'uucp'.

[DRY RUN] Would add user 'me' to group 'uucp'

*** The Oracle has spoken. Go now, and create wonders. ***
```

The enhanced dial is **100% backward compatible**:

# These work exactly as before
dial                           # Default behavior unchanged
dial -p wizard                 # Same personality system
dial -d /dev/ttyUSB0          # Same device specification
dial -h                       # Same help (now enhanced)

# Plus all the new features
dial -c                       # NEW: Check groups  
dial -l                       # NEW: List devices
dial -n -d /dev/video0        # NEW: Dry run mode
dial --verbose --scan         # NEW: Enhanced discovery
```

## üåü What's Enhanced

| Feature | Original | Enhanced |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Device Support** | Single device only | Multiple with auto-discovery |
| **Error Handling** | Basic "not found" | Suggestions + alternatives |
| **Status Checking** | None | Group membership + device info |
| **Safety** | Direct execution | Dry-run + validation |
| **CLI** | Basic getopts | Modern arg parsing + long options |
| **Logging** | None | Full operation history |
| **Discovery** | Manual only | Smart categorized scanning |

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use `-c` first** to see what groups you're already in
2. **Use `-l` to explore** available devices on your system  
3. **Use `-n` to test** before making changes
4. **Use `-v` to debug** when something goes wrong
5. **Use `-s` to discover** devices you didn't know existed
